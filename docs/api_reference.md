# API Reference

This page contains the API Reference for your HSDS Profile. It was automatically generated by reading the `schema/openapi.json` file in your Profile repository.

You can also change how this page renders, by changing the directives below. You should read the [sphinxcontrib-openapi documentation](https://sphinxcontrib-openapi.readthedocs.io/) to discover how to manipulate the output to your liking.

You may want to render each endpoint separately, to put some explanatory text around each API endpoint or to include some example output:

```
.. openapi:: ../../schema/openapi.json
   :paths:
      /
   :encoding: utf-8
```

You can wrap this directive inside some tabs, if you wanted to include some example output on another tab:

````
::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Details

```{eval-rst}
.. openapi:: ../../schema/openapi.json
   :paths:
      /
   :encoding: utf-8
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Example Response

```{eval-rst}
.. jsoninclude:: ../../examples/base.json
    :jsonpointer:
    :title: base
```
:::

::::

````

Unfortunately, we cannot generate such tabs and examples for you automatically because the documentation tooling does not pre-parse your openapi file to create this page. It reads it directly from the generated `schema/openapi.json` file for your Profile.
