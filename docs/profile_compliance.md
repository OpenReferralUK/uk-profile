# Profile Compliance

This is a skeleton page which you should fill out with all the details required to make data compliant with your profile.

It's a good idea to:

* Explicitly list all changes from core HSDS including new fields, fields you've removed, new API endpoints, etc.
* Highlight whether there are additional requirements such as a guarantee of openness of the API endpoints.


## Changes from HSDS

Use this section to highlight changes from HSDS.

It might be a good idea to list these by schema (table/object), and then by what has been added and what has been removed within that scope.
